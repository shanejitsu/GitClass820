            <h2>Nagbagyo sa Japan</h2>
            <p>Posted on August 22, 2024</p>

            <p>Hundreds of thousands of people are being advised to evacuate in parts of Japan, with some homes losing power on Friday, as Typhoon Ampil approaches the east coast near the capital.
                The storm, located 121 nautical miles southeast of Yokosuka, Greater Tokyo, has intensified to the equivalent strength of a Category 4 hurricane, bringing winds of up to 212 kilometers per hour (131 mph) as it moves north at 18 kph (11 mph), according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC).
                Ampil has rapidly intensified over the past two days, partly because it moved over very warm water – meaning more moisture in the air to fuel the typhoon. It could strengthen further in the next 12 hours, with the storm reaching peak intensity as it passes by Japan.</p>

            <h2>Init napud ang Philippines</h2>

            <p>With temperatures soaring across the Philippines, people are finding creative ways to beat the heat. In the midst of the scorching sun, one man decided to cool off by taking an outdoor shower, using nothing more than a garden hose and a few moments of respite from the relentless heat. The simple act of bathing outside not only provided immediate relief but also served as a reminder of how adaptable and resilient people can be in the face of nature's challenges.

                The summer season in the Philippines is notorious for its intense heat, often driving people to seek refuge wherever they can find it. Whether it's under the shade of a tree, in an air-conditioned room, or, as in this case, in a refreshing outdoor shower, the need to stay cool becomes a priority for everyone.
                
                But the heat doesn't just affect comfort—it also impacts health, with risks of heat exhaustion and dehydration becoming real concerns during the hottest days. Simple measures like staying hydrated, wearing light clothing, and, of course, finding ways to cool down, are essential in navigating the harsh summer climate.
                
                As temperatures continue to rise, this man's approach is a perfect example of making the most out of what's available. It may be a simple solution, but it's an effective one, reminding us all to find joy and relief in the little things during these hot summer days.</p>

            <h2>Alice Guo Away</h2>
            <p>Posted on August 20, 2024</p>

            <p>TAn ex-mayor in the Philippines, Alice Guo, who is accused of spying for China and facilitating criminal activities like human trafficking and illegal gambling, has fled the country, prompting outrage. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. vowed accountability after it was revealed that Guo, who had been under investigation and ordered to testify before a Senate panel, managed to leave the Philippines undetected a month ago. Guo, who had connections to scam operations disguised as online casinos, has denied the allegations, but her departure underscores significant corruption within the justice system. Her escape has sparked a backlash, particularly from Senator Risa Hontiveros, who criticized the failure of immigration authorities to prevent her from fleeing. The incident occurs against a backdrop of increasing tensions between the Philippines and China, particularly over territorial disputes in the South China Sea.</p>
